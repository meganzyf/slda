We utilize domain adaptation for the estimation of Einstein radius in simulated galaxy-scale gravitational lensing images with different levels
of observational realism. The technique used here is Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We also include a sample tutorial on using MMD. Link to paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.17238
